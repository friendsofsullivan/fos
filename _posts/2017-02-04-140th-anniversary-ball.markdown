We celebrated the school’s 140th Anniversary in spectacular fashion with a Gala Ball at Titanic Belfast on 4th February 2017.

The entire night raised an incredible amount of  £26 000. Pictures from the night can be seen on the ‘Friends of Sullivan’ facebook page or click [here][googledrive]

The event was attended by over 600 guests including staff, governors, parents, past parents, Year 14 pupils and of course former pupils. 

We were pleased to see many flying in from Great Britain and Europe, individuals even travelled from the  United States and the Cayman Islands just to attend the celebrations. 

Mark Simpson and Alison Fleming hosted the evening with great skill and panache and Flash Harry provided the entertainment. The guest auctioneer on the evening and former pupil, David Jeffrey did an outstanding job auctioning a range of  unique lots - some of which had been donated by notable alumni. 

Lots included an Ulster Rugby Stadium Tour with personal guide, Darren Cave, and a 4 hour bake off masterclass with the Great British Bake Off star, Andrew Smyth. Sky news presenter Dermot Murnaghan, who flew in from London with many of his former classmates, also participated in the evening’s proceedings.
