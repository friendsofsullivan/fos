A highlight of the school’s calendar for many. Pupils from Prep 1 - Year 14, donned their sporting attire to be covered head to toe in all the colours of the rainbow by teachers and members of staff. 

All whilst taking part in a 5K fun run at the school. Through participant sponsorship the event raised over £7000 for the Sullivan Upper Appeal Fund.
